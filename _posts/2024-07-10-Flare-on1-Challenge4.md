# Write-up
Upon extracting the archive, we are presented with a file named `APT9001.pdf`, identified as a `PDF document, version 1.5`.

Running the `strings` command on the file reveals some obfuscated strings related to possible scripting. One particularly interesting string is `/Fla#74eDe#63o#64#65 /AS#43IIHexD#65cod#65 ]`, which decodes to `/FlateDecode /ASCIIHexDecode`.

To analyze any embedded scripts, we can use a tool called [Origami](https://github.com/gdelugre/origami)

`sudo apt install origami-pdf`

First, let's use `pdfcop`:

As shown in the screenshot, a `/Javascript` action was found. Next, let's use the `pdfextract` tool, also part of `Origami`.

Great, we have extracted a script file. Let's open it in the best text editor [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) ðŸ˜‰

It appears to be an obfuscated JavaScript file with excessively long variable names. Let's rename them for clarity.

Much better! In a previous blog post, [Unraveling the Mysteries of Malware in the Wild](https://binarybobcat.github.io/Unraveling-the-Mysteries-of-Malware-in-the-Wild) I encountered a similar malware sample in a PDF. From that experience, I know the `encodedPayload` is likely the key focus, containing the escaped data. We'll use the following JavaScript snippet to write out the unescaped raw binary data to a file:

```js
const fs = require('fs');

// Convert unescaped string to binary
function unicodeToBinary(unicodeString) {
    const binaryArray = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < unicodeString.length; i++) {
        const charCode = unicodeString.charCodeAt(i);
        binaryArray.push(charCode & 0xFF); // Low byte
        binaryArray.push(charCode >> 8);   // High byte
    }
    return new Uint8Array(binaryArray);
}

// Combine the secondaryDataArray into one string
let combinedData = '';
for (let i = 0; i < encodedPayload.length; i++) {
    combinedData += encodedPayload[i];
}

// Convert combined data to binary
const binaryPayload = unicodeToBinary(combinedData);

// Write binary data to file
fs.writeFileSync('encodedPayload.bin', Buffer.from(binaryPayload));

console.log('Binary data written to encodedPayload.bin');
```

After appending this code to the file, we run it to extract the "decoded" payload into `encodedPayload.bin`.

Now that we have the raw bytes of the payload, we need to determine its nature. My initial thought is that it could be shellcode. Let's use `ndisasm` to see if it disassembles into any recognizable opcodes.

```shell
ndisasm -b 32 -p intel encodedPayload.bin
```

The results are lengthy, but itâ€™s clear this contains Intel opcodes and a section using XOR decryption.

To execute this shellcode, we can create a harness program. After several unsuccessful attempts creating my own harness programs related towards memory errors, I found another approach using [BlobRunner](https://github.com/OALabs/BlobRunner).

```shell
.\blobrunner.exe encodedPayload.bin
```

With the program running, we can attach to the `blobrunner` process using `x32dbg` or `IDA`.

Next, we'll set a breakpoint at the "XOR decryption" section.

Continuing the program execution reveals a MessageBox.

We observe the data being XOR decrypted twice before being displayed.

Single-stepping through the decryption process shows the data before its final XOR operation.
