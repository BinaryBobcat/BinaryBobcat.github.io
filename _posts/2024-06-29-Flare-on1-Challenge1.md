# Write-up

To kick things off, I like to gather basic information about the file I'm working with, such as its type and size. The `file` command is a great first step for this.

```shell
file Challenge1.exe

Challenge1.exe: PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386 Mono/.Net assembly, for MS Windows
```

This tells us that we are dealing with a 64-bit .NET Windows binary. If this were malware, I wouldnâ€™t run it right away, but since it's a CTF challenge, let's go ahead and execute the program.

The application opens up to a GUI featuring a Bob Ross painting and a "Decode" button. When we press the "Decode" button, the image changes and we're presented with a garbled string output.

Next, let's explore what happens when we click the "Decode" button. My go-to tool for decompiling .NET programs is dnSpy. Loading the binary in dnSpy, we can locate several functions, with the `btnDecode_Click` function standing out.

Inside this function, there are three for loops generating strings. Let's set a breakpoint at the end of these loops and run the program to inspect their values.

The string `text1` is being built from `dat_secret` which appears to be the flag, while the other two strings, `text2` and `text3`, seem to further mangle each other until the final result is displayed as an unreadable string.

That was a straightforward challenge! ðŸ˜‚
