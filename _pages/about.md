Hi, I'm Aaron, a Cybersecurity Professional with a passion for `offensive security`, including `reverse engineering`, `penetration testing` of operational technology, and `exploit development`. My enthusiasm for cybersecurity extends beyond my professional work, and I enjoy engaging in related activities during my spare time. I started a blog to share my research and findings, showcase CTF writeups, and contribute to the growth of the community's knowledge.

ðŸ‘¾ **I LOVE Reverse Engineering!!**

I'm passionate about delving into the intricacies of software and hardware, uncovering their secrets, and understanding how they work from the inside out. Reverse engineering is not just a hobby for me; it's a way of life.

â˜• **Coffee keeps me alive**

My constant companion on this journey is a good cup of coffee. It's the fuel that powers my late-night coding sessions and deep dives into complex problems.

ðŸ§© **I like attending CTF events to further my knowledge**

Capture the Flag (CTF) events are my playground. They challenge me, push my limits, and help me continuously expand my knowledge and skills in cybersecurity.
